# Data Structures and Algorithms

I am currently studying this module. I would like to have a thorough grounding in the theories and application of computer algorithms, abstract data types, underlying data structures and their integration to produce efficient programs. I  hope that it will develop my knowledge and skills to design, implement,
and analyse effective algorithmic solutions.
I will use this repository to upload my tutorial notebooks for coding exercises and programming labs during this course.  


## Books 
I am using the the following two books to study this course:

### [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.wiley.com/college/goodrich) 
Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, Michael H. Goldwasser.

### [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html) 
Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures.
